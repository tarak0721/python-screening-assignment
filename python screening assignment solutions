1. Create a function in python to read the text file and replace specific content
of the file.

file1 = open("example.txt","r")
# Python program to replace text in a file
x = input("enter text to be replaced:")
y = input("enter text that will replace:")
 
# file.txt should be replaced with
# the actual text file name
f = open("example.txt", "r+")
 
# each sentence becomes an element in the list l
l = f.readlines()
 
# acts as a counter to know the
# index of the element to be replaced
c = 0
for i in l:
    if x in i:
        Replacement = i.replace(x, y)
 
        # changes are made in the list
        l = Replacement
    c += 1
 
# The pre existing text in the file is erased
f.truncate(0)
 
# the modified list is written into
# the file thereby replacing the old text
f.writelines(l)
f.close()
print("Text successfully replaced")
